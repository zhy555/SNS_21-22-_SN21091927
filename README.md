# SNS_21-22-_SN21091927

To run the code, first run the pre-process.py, then run the SNS_recieve.py in the terminal by command (because I use flask-script to implement the server and clinet part)

Details library needed and how to run the code in terminal have been mentioned in my report. 

Tensorflow-gpu is 2.6.0, the CUDA version is 11.2, while the GPU is 3060ti and Nivida driver is in version 496.76, the cuDNN version is 8.1.0. 

type <python SNS_revieve.py CNN_predict> in terminal, in the path where the SNS_revieve.py is. 

If there are problems in running my code, please contact me without hestiation, my email is uceehak@ucl.ac.uk
